# Business-Case-Analyst_NguyenMinhHoang

Simulate a business analysis task I handle frequently.

Business analysis case:
I received a new business request this year.

I performed an overview analysis - broke down the issues to identify available resources and 
discussed with the operators to come up with an outline of possible solutions and possible work-arounds. from the perspective of Data.

Finally, as a Data Analyst, I have launched a reporting / dashboard Power BI system to track important indicators for 
the purpose of strictly controlling the progress of completing the project's tasks.
